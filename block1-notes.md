>           - MECM

> - Vulnerability Scanning
>   - Assesses known weaknesses in endpoints, networks, & applications
>   - Creates an inventory of assets on the network
>   - Identifies OS versions, software, ports, & accounts/user activity

> - Compliance Scanning
>   - Focusses on configuration & system hardening
>   - Checks adherence to compliance framework
>       - Examples
>           - Risk Management Framework (RMF DoD 8500)
